    A Quick Guide to VN Market Research

    There's a lot of ways to try your market research, but your starting point is going to be: \"What genre is my game? What age range is it appropriate for?\"

    With a genre and age range you can start to look at online communities to find your audience. You may also be able to find existing market research that other people have published online that you can take a look at.

    One of the easiest ways to gather your own research is to make an online survey form and share the link to places that you feel might be relevant to your game and topics. Although when in places like groups or discord servers, it is a good idea to double check that sharing these kinds of links is allowed.

    When you're making your online survey, think carefully about what you {i}need{/i} to know and how to ask those questions to get usable answers. 

    So for example you might want to know what age groups are looking at playing the kind of game you're making. You could ask people to enter their exact age, but this will likely be less useful as data. Instead you could use a multiple choice for age brackets.

    You may also be tempted to ask things like what people's favourite character trope is, but this may not be as useful to what you need. If you've already decided on the character tropes you're using and don't want to change them, then this answer isn't likely to be helpful even though it is relevant.

    When you've collected enough answers, too, it can help to compare the answers to each other. So you might want to look at how many people with English as a primary/main language like to have voice acting in English in games they play or if it's something they aren't interested in. 
    
    This could help you decide if you want English language voice acting or if it isn't worth the cost/effort to include it. 

    That's just an example of how to approach the topic, and you can always repeat your market research when you have some examples or even a demo to look at potential player feedback.

    You would also do well to look at other similar games to the one you want to make and play them through while taking notes. What do you like about them? What things are you less fond of? How do these features/tropes/notes correspond to your own plans and how you want to proceed?

    Of course, you shouldn't copy anything directly or exactly, but knowing your competition is usually a wise idea and there is no harm in deciding on more general things that you like and dislike. After all, you're more than likely here and thinking about making your own VN game after playing a few, right?

    A Quick Guide to Marketing Your Visual Novel

    The aim of marketing is to build up interest in your game before its release, and to sustain more interest and fans after the game is released too.

    This might be direct advertising, and it might also be maintaining a presence in various forms of social media.

    First, though, you should know where your target audience is most likely to be, as well as what forms of media you are willing and able to maintain.

    For example, if your target audience don't use Twitter you'd be wasting your time marketing there. But even if your target audience {i}do{/i} use it, then you need to be able to utilise it consistently and effectively to reach them and keep engagement up.

    It is often better to keep your personal online presence separate to your development presence. You can, of course, share things from your personal pages, but your main audience don't need to be seeing your personal updates, memes, and opinions that aren't related to your game. Keep your development profiles clean and clear, focused on the content relating to your game.

    There are some good guides online for how to market your visual novel, so I recommend taking a look at those from the resources menu or searching for any others through your usual search engine. You may find some that are more closely related to the genre of your own game.

    You may also want to consider the timing of when your game releases, unless it is part of a jam and needs to adhere to the jam's release schedule.

    Horror games will do better when released in October, but you might not want to wait until the 31st for Halloween itself. You'll find players looking for horror games before the 31st so they're ready to stream them or upload gameplay, or simply have them ready to play on the night.

    Romance games might do better with a release around Valentine's Day in February, although you may also find the market more competitive with this release date so it could be harder to stand out. You could, however, have a reduced price offer or get involved in the seasonal sales and promotions for the platforms you are distributing on. 

    Other dates throughout the year can still be helpful for promoting your game, as you can use them for extra images. For example, you could have a special art piece made of one or more characters in a seasonally relevant costume. Think about the ways this might link to your intended target audience, too. Even more comical holidays like International Talk Like A Pirate Day could be an opportunity to boost your reach.

    Some of you might be considering using things like Kickstarter or Patreon to help fund your project, and this will need to be planned in advance too. If you make promises for content you need to know you can deliver on this, and to be able to deliver on time particularly with subscription based models like Patreon. It may be tempting to add more stretch goals and features, but be certain you're able to meet these first.

    You will also need to stick to the terms and conditions of those websites, too. Make sure that your content will be suitable for the fundraising platforms, just as you will when looking at release platforms.

    One key to your marketing can also be in how you present your sales page. It's strongly advised to have several screenshots and at least a short teaser trailer video showing some of your game.

    You'll likely do better having a solid trailer to show people what to expect with the features, quality, and style of the game. This may mean you need a YouTube account to host the video to be able to show it on sites like itch.io - this should ideally be separate to your personal channel or any channels you have for non-VN content. 
    
    You may want to familiarise yourself with screen recording software like OBS, or a similar capture software that allows you to record an application or display. 
    
    You can even build your demo in Ren'py using the assets from your game and some clever uses of transitions, transforms, and other cinematography within Ren'py itself to record. This is best done in a separate new project, unless you have the trailer as an extra feature inside the final game for people to view from the menu.

    How you approach it is up to you, but screenshots, demos, and trailer videos are a great way to get players interested in your product and can be a powerful marketing tool.

    One final tool to mention for games that are being sold is the potential to give free copies out to a handful of reviewers or even streamers. 
    
    It's unlikely a first time game dev will get the notice of a big name with millions of followers unless they already have connections, but you can look to review websites for your genre of game and streamers with a modest but reasonable following who have streamed games similar to yours in the past. 

    There's no guarantee people will take up your free copies, or provide the boost in sales you're hoping for, but if you happen to catch the right person and they (and their audience) enjoy what you have to offer, you could gain yourself some notice and popularity that you might otherwise not have found.

    Keep in mind that streamers and reviewers might get a lot of these offers, so it's possible they may not have the time or energy to respond to yours. It's worth a shot, but be polite, courteous, and don't flood anyone's inboxes with reminders. The last thing you need is a negative shout out!

    Testers and Testing - Your Overview of Feedback

    There's a few types of feedback you might need for your project at different stages, so let's break those down first.

    - Writing and Story. This would mean things like the overall writing quality, looking for plotholes, whether the story as a whole makes sense to the reader. It may also include things like pacing (whether the story progresses to quickly or too slowly) and sensitivity reading for difficult topics.

    - Character Writing and Dialogue. You may want to know how your characters are coming across to the players. Whether they have unique and recognisable voices, if their personalities are being interpreted in the way you intended, and if their dialogue is well balanced (no one character talking far more than any other in places where it should be more even).

    - Character Design. This one you may want to look at feedback on earlier in the process, around the concept stage. That said, you can still look at feedback later on, and also with things like whether the sprite expressions match the moods of the characters at the appropriate times.

    - Background Design. This again might be one that's harder to act on later down the line, but it is probably good to know whether the backgrounds suit the story and if they interfere with the other on screen visuals like the GUI, dialogue, and sprites. You may be able to adjust the backgrounds by editing brightness and contrast, or applying a slight filter over the top of them, which can help with visibility of other assets.

    - Music and Sound. Knowing whether the volume is well balanced for players is going to be important, and whether your sound effects are adding to the story or becoming intrusive or unwelcome. Some players might always opt to turn off the music or disable the sound effects, which is a valid player choice, but you may well want some feedback on this from people who generally leave them on.

    - GUI. How usable your interface is could potentially make or break a game. Players need to be able to see and use all the important functions, like save/load, preferences menus, and main menus. The font also needs to be legible to the majority of your audience, as well as fitting the tone of your game. A fanciful curly handwriting script might look lovely as a style choice, but if it's hard to read it's no good for your potential fans! 

    - Accessibility. This will depend on which accessibility options you want to feature, but I strongly recommend considering utilising them even if they're things you don't usually use yourself. Things like the built-in Self Voicing that Ren'py has by default is a big one that may need testing, which we will go over in more detail in the Accessibility section.

    - Mini Games and Extra Features. If you have mini games or extra features, you'll need to know how well they function. Do players find them too easy or too difficult? Do they know what to do or do you need to add more instruction in the game for them? Do all of your features do what you wanted them to do, and do they add to the game experience or are they too much?

    - Errors and Typos. This might be the obvious one, but you should have a way for players to alert you to any game breaking bugs, visual errors, or typos you have. This might be the more awkward one to fix, but you could add in a testing feedback box to help players flag errors in a usable way for you to action later. There will be a link to an example on this in resources!

    p "Alright so now we know what topics we need to cover, but how?"

    p "Some things you may want to ask multiple choice questions, and other places it might be better to leave a larger text box space for the tester to explain their feedback."
    p "It is up to you how you gather feedback, but you should know what you want to know and ensure that testers have a way to give you those answers in a way you can utilise to improve your game."
    p "Unfortunately, if you don't let testers know what you're looking for with feedback, you may only hear things like:"
    "Playtester 1" "Yeah I really enjoyed the game, can't wait for the full release."
    "Playtester B" "My favourite character was [p] but I felt like there were too many spelling mistakes."
    "Playtester %" "I didn't find any errors or points where the game didn't work. It all ran smoothly, no crashes."
    p "Of course some of that feedback might be useful, but it could be a lot more detailed or specific to things you can change and work on."
    p "You might also find that there's some feedback you don't want to act on, where you disagree with a tester's opinion about something, and that's fine - you should be making a game you are happy to make."
    p "However, if multiple testers have an issue with the same thing, it might be worth considering other options for how to approach changing that part or how to edit the game to fix the specific part they were less fond of."
    p "Once you've made changes, and/or progressed to the next development milestone, it's a good idea to see if your testers will give it another go and see if the improvements you've made have worked out as intended."
    p "Like with other roles, it might be difficult to find good testers willing to work for free, and particularly if you're project is a longer one you may need to consider putting a small budget aside to pay for a couple of experienced people to give you useful feedback."

    p "Other places, like itch.io, may allow you to pretty instantly make your project available for your audience to download and play with no fees. This can make it a popular release platform for new developers, although itch does have a smaller audience and userbase than mainstream platforms like Steam."

    p "Check in the terms and conditions too, as some may refund developers after they reach a certain number of downloads."
    p "Some platforms might even have ongoing fees to maintain your game's presence on there, which I believe is the case for iOS. So you'd have to pay to keep your game on there each year, even if the game is free for people to download and play."
    p "Some of these fees are in place to reduce malware and scam products, and others will help to cover the running costs of the platform and general hosting of your game."
