    A Quick Guide to VN Market Research

    There's a lot of ways to try your market research, but your starting point is going to be: \"What genre is my game? What age range is it appropriate for?\"

    With a genre and age range you can start to look at online communities to find your audience. You may also be able to find existing market research that other people have published online that you can take a look at.

    One of the easiest ways to gather your own research is to make an online survey form and share the link to places that you feel might be relevant to your game and topics. Although when in places like groups or discord servers, it is a good idea to double check that sharing these kinds of links is allowed.

    When you're making your online survey, think carefully about what you {i}need{/i} to know and how to ask those questions to get usable answers. 

    So for example you might want to know what age groups are looking at playing the kind of game you're making. You could ask people to enter their exact age, but this will likely be less useful as data. Instead you could use a multiple choice for age brackets.

    You may also be tempted to ask things like what people's favourite character trope is, but this may not be as useful to what you need. If you've already decided on the character tropes you're using and don't want to change them, then this answer isn't likely to be helpful even though it is relevant.

    When you've collected enough answers, too, it can help to compare the answers to each other. So you might want to look at how many people with English as a primary/main language like to have voice acting in English in games they play or if it's something they aren't interested in. 
    
    This could help you decide if you want English language voice acting or if it isn't worth the cost/effort to include it. 

    That's just an example of how to approach the topic, and you can always repeat your market research when you have some examples or even a demo to look at potential player feedback.

    You would also do well to look at other similar games to the one you want to make and play them through while taking notes. What do you like about them? What things are you less fond of? How do these features/tropes/notes correspond to your own plans and how you want to proceed?

    Of course, you shouldn't copy anything directly or exactly, but knowing your competition is usually a wise idea and there is no harm in deciding on more general things that you like and dislike. After all, you're more than likely here and thinking about making your own VN game after playing a few, right?

    A Quick Guide to Marketing Your Visual Novel

    The aim of marketing is to build up interest in your game before its release, and to sustain more interest and fans after the game is released too.

    This might be direct advertising, and it might also be maintaining a presence in various forms of social media.

    First, though, you should know where your target audience is most likely to be, as well as what forms of media you are willing and able to maintain.

    For example, if your target audience don't use Twitter you'd be wasting your time marketing there. But even if your target audience {i}do{/i} use it, then you need to be able to utilise it consistently and effectively to reach them and keep engagement up.

    It is often better to keep your personal online presence separate to your development presence. You can, of course, share things from your personal pages, but your main audience don't need to be seeing your personal updates, memes, and opinions that aren't related to your game. Keep your development profiles clean and clear, focused on the content relating to your game.

    There are some good guides online for how to market your visual novel, so I recommend taking a look at those from the resources menu or searching for any others through your usual search engine. You may find some that are more closely related to the genre of your own game.

    You may also want to consider the timing of when your game releases, unless it is part of a jam and needs to adhere to the jam's release schedule.

    Horror games will do better when released in October, but you might not want to wait until the 31st for Halloween itself. You'll find players looking for horror games before the 31st so they're ready to stream them or upload gameplay, or simply have them ready to play on the night.

    Romance games might do better with a release around Valentine's Day in February, although you may also find the market more competitive with this release date so it could be harder to stand out. You could, however, have a reduced price offer or get involved in the seasonal sales and promotions for the platforms you are distributing on. 

    Other dates throughout the year can still be helpful for promoting your game, as you can use them for extra images. For example, you could have a special art piece made of one or more characters in a seasonally relevant costume. Think about the ways this might link to your intended target audience, too. Even more comical holidays like International Talk Like A Pirate Day could be an opportunity to boost your reach.

    Some of you might be considering using things like Kickstarter or Patreon to help fund your project, and this will need to be planned in advance too. If you make promises for content you need to know you can deliver on this, and to be able to deliver on time particularly with subscription based models like Patreon. It may be tempting to add more stretch goals and features, but be certain you're able to meet these first.

    You will also need to stick to the terms and conditions of those websites, too. Make sure that your content will be suitable for the fundraising platforms, just as you will when looking at release platforms.

    p "The launcher also allows you to build for Andriod and iOS, but these may require more work. For example, if the game is to be compatible with mobile devices, it may need to have the GUI and images redesigned to suit the smaller screen size."
    p "For that reason, as well as the difficulty of ensuring Android builds will be fully compatible with the huge array of different mobile phones on the market, it is less common for games to be released in those formats. It is something to consider ahead of time."
    p "Ideally, you will want to be able to test the constructed builds on each of the systems you have made the game for prior to uploading them to your chosen release platforms. Be extra certain that everything functions as intended. It's better to take the time to check than to have unhappy players later!"
