label marketing:
    p "Marketing is all about promoting your game, and even selling it if you're releasing your game as a paid project rather than a free to play game."
    p "There are all sorts of different ways to approach the topic, but sometimes it is worth thinking about before your game is complete or even has much content ready."
    p "And that is all around Market Research."
    p "Market Research really applies more to projects you want to sell and make money from, and I will caution that you should always ensure your first target audience is...YOU!" 
    p "You need to be making a game {i}you{/i} like, otherwise you're at far greater risk of dropping out before you finish. It's like writing a book, you should write a book that you would want to read because you'll be reading it over and over before it's done."
    p "But besides yourself, you may want to know who your target audience is and what they are looking for in a game. This can also be very helpful when deciding what features to include in your project."

    A Quick Guide to VN Market Research

    There's a lot of ways to try your market research, but your starting point is going to be: \"What genre is my game? What age range is it appropriate for?\"

    With a genre and age range you can start to look at online communities to find your audience. You may also be able to find existing market research that other people have published online that you can take a look at.

    One of the easiest ways to gather your own research is to make an online survey form and share the link to places that you feel might be relevant to your game and topics. Although when in places like groups or discord servers, it is a good idea to double check that sharing these kinds of links is allowed.

    When you're making your online survey, think carefully about what you {i}need{/i} to know and how to ask those questions to get usable answers. 

    So for example you might want to know what age groups are looking at playing the kind of game you're making. You could ask people to enter their exact age, but this will likely be less useful as data. Instead you could use a multiple choice for age brackets.

    You may also be tempted to ask things like what people's favourite character trope is, but this may not be as useful to what you need. If you've already decided on the character tropes you're using and don't want to change them, then this answer isn't likely to be helpful even though it is relevant.

    When you've collected enough answers, too, it can help to compare the answers to each other. So you might want to look at how many people with English as a primary/main language like to have voice acting in English in games they play or if it's something they aren't interested in. 
    
    This could help you decide if you want English language voice acting or if it isn't worth the cost/effort to include it. 

    That's just an example of how to approach the topic, and you can always repeat your market research when you have some examples or even a demo to look at potential playyer feedback.
