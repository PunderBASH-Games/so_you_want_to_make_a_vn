    Job Role Overview - A list of the skills and creators you might need. These do not have to be different people, they could all just be one person, but they're all things that will need to be covered at some point in development. Exact job titles may vary, or you can call them whatever you like too.

    - Music: Composer (to write the music), music tech/mixing specialist (to master and balance the tracks), performers (if using recordings of real instrument performances and/or vocals).

    - Art: Background artist, Character artist, CG artist, GUI artist, potentially a web designer to help with your game cover and store pages.

    - Writing: Lead Writer, editor (the writer could edit themselves but will need to carefully read everything multiple times to do so), beta reader (optional for story feedback and finding errors the editor missed), translator (if you're including multiple language releases).

    - Programming (code): General programmer (making the story work), specialist (optional if needed for mini games or extra features), version control and release manager (to make the game builds and upload them onto the release platforms)

    - Sound: Sound effects lead (choosing which sounds to use and where they go), sound effect mixer (to edit and check the sound balance of any effects used)

    - Testers: General beta tester, accessibility tester (if including accessibility options), bug tester (to play through every possible route and choice combination to check for errors)

    - General: Creative director (someone to organise the job roles and communicate with the team as a leader), publisher (to organise releases), marketer (to promote the game and potentially do market research), social media manager (if your game/team has specific social media for promotion.) 
    
    - Finances: Financial manager, who will be handling any income from a game you sell and/or to ensure people are paid their share of profits and commission prices. This role should always keep a list of expensees paid out to make the game, including software and hardware purchased specifically to make the game.

    - Voice Acting: Recruiter (to go through auditions and decide who gets what parts), director (to direct performances and choose which lines make the cut), sound mixer (to check quality and volume balances), performers, voice manager (to track and place all of the lines in the game)

    p "Filling all those job roles might seem like a big task, but it is an essential part of indie video game development. Many jobs there for a small game may not take a lot of time or work at all, too, but still need doing!"
    p "Keep a solid track of anyone who has provided work or assets for your game and make sure they are properly credited. It's important to acknowledge their input, and to credit yourself for all the hard work you did too!"

label teams:
    p "So if you're not working alone, your next best bet is to find a team!"
    p "Teams can be great, but they also come with their own challenges too."
    p "If you're the project leader, you'll need to manage your team and make sure there's clear communication within the team when it is needed."
    p "A composer might not need to work with a writer, but you may well need your artist and programmer roles to collaborate in places like image sizes and whether you are using layered images or individual solid images."
    p "You might find it easier to find friends who would like to work with you on your passion project or an idea you've had together, but keep in mind this might come with its own unique stresses."
    p "When working with friends, you'll want to be very clear about who is doing what, and make sure you all keep communicating. You may also want to keep the project work separate to social bonds, so you put your project hats on when you're working and take them off when you're doing casual friend things."
    p "Another potential issue is when friends are keen to help at the start, but their interest or free time might drop off over time, particularly if it's a larger project."
    p "This can be disappointing, but not everyone will maintain the same passion for a project as you especially if they're volunteering to help unpaid. Remember that making a VN as a hobby is optional, and people may want or need to opt out for a number of reasons."
    p "Still, that shouldn't put you off from trying to work with friends - sometimes friend teams can be a great source of motivation, and already knowing each other means you don't need to break the ice!"
    p "But what if you're not going to work with your pals?"

    Building Your Team

    - Game Jams. This is a great way to make a first game and get some experience! Lots of game jams will have team recruitment sessions where you can meet others with a variety of skills and form groups to fill all the job roles. These small short term projects could lead to future collaborations, or may be a one time thing that gives you confidence in working with teams in the future.

    - Reddit. There are VN Dev communities on Reddit where you might be able to look for people to recruit, or find teams who are recruiting for people with the skills you have. When looking for teams, remember to give people details of your project, deadlines, workload, job roles needed, and any pay rates.

    - Discord. There's a lot of discord dev communities, from general ones like Ren'py and DevTalk, to communities more focused on individual genres like Otome games. Some servers even have specific channels to offer your skills or to post team openings, as well as the meet and greet recruitment sessions for game jams linked to those servers. 

    - Lemmasoft Forums. It is always worth having a look or posting on the forums when you're trying to form or join a team, there are people with lots of different projects in the making. It's hard to guarantee success, but the more places you look the more chances you have at finding the right people.

    - Other Websites. There's lots of other social and creative websites and platforms out there, from DeviantArt to Fiverr and too many others to name. Whether you're looking to join a team or hiring someone, it is helpful to have your own portfolio of sample work and to look at potential team members' samples too. Again, the more places you look, the more chances of finding the right people to work with.

    - IRL Clubs and Groups. Working with people you know In Real Life (outside of these fun little screens) can have its own unique challenges, but it can also be a source of motivation and an easier way to collaborate when you don't have to work out schedules to be online at the same time.

    p "Once you've found your team, make sure you have clearly assigned job roles and everyone knows what they are doing and who to ask if they have questions or issues."
    p "Communicating is the real key, so remember to talk to people and listen to them."
    p "Of course there may be times where a team isn't working, and that's ok. It happens! We are all people (or box-like constructs) and that means sometimes we don't get along, or there are things in life that take priority so we can't continue."
    p "If your team does lose someone, or disband completely, make sure it is clear what work belongs to who. It is important that people know if/when/where they're able to share work they've done, or use it to continue the same or other projects in different teams."
    p "It isn't entirely uncommon for people to need to replace a team member in a project before it is done for a number of reasons, and you should still credit (and pay) team members for work they did that is used in any released project even if they weren't with it til the end."
    p "You should also make sure you are working with people you can trust, and protect your ideas and designs when you need to."
    p "Finding free teams is always going to be harder, but if you find the right people who have the same level of passion to make the game you all want to make then it definitely can be done!"

    p "As a solo dev you will have full creative control over your project, but you will also be responsible for filling all the job roles and either making, finding, or commissioning all of your assets."
    p "This is absolutely possible, but it might also mean being more careful with the scope of your project. Making a game alone is a lot of hard work, but if you have that motivation and drive to see it through you can absolutely do it!"
    p "There's not much more to say about working solo, except to really prepare your pipeline and keep a handle on all of your workload."
    p "I don't want to put you off from getting stuck in! But knowing what you're taking on and planning well can be the difference between being able to get through it all to the end or getting overwhelmed and feeling unable to finish."

    p "If it isn't working for you, then you don't have an obligation to complete it. You can take it as a learning experience to help you with the next project that you {i}can{/i} finish!"
