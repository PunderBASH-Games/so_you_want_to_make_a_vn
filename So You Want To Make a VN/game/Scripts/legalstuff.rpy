    Preventing Piracy

    - Compiling Builds. When you release your finished game, or even your demo, you will make a \"build\". This will take all of your files and assets to compile it into a single program. That makes it harder for people to take individual pieces like art or music files, and they can't see your source code in the files. When testing, only give people builds of the game rather than sending them all of your uncompiled files and folders.

    - Archiving. People with more knowledge than me can tell you how to further protect the files inside your builds, but do remember that determined people will still have ways past this, it'll just take them longer.

    - Release Platforms. Releasing your demo or game will likely require it to be on a storefront like Steam or itch.io and these will have their own publishing procedures to help protect your game. Always check the agreements, terms, and how trustworthy a site is before uploading your game to it for release, particularly if it isn't a well known and used store front like Itch and Steam.

    - Using Github and Collaborating. If you're working with a team and using file sharing or collaborative tools like Github, keep your repositories private to protect the contents. Only allow people access who actually {i}need{/i} access to the source files in order to fulfil their development role. A public repo can be accessed by the public, so they'll be able to see what's in there and all the change logs as you make them too.

    - Google Drive and Other File Sharing. If you're distributing with tools like Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar, one way to protect those files is to restrict access. Google Drive you can have permission only access, so people will need to be logged in with their email address. This doesn't stop them pirating from there, but it does give you full control over who has access which you can revoke at any time.

    A Brief Guide to Age Ratings
    
    Age ratings will tell your players what age group audience your game is appropriate for. This is very likely to vary with different regions, as different countries have different standards for what is considered age appropriate for different groups.

    Because of the localised differences, you might find your game has a higher rating in some places than others. Generally though unless your VN gets very popular, you won't need to get approval from specific licencing boards.

    Steam already has its own way of determining content and age groups. When you go through the process of publishing your game to Steam, you will find they have a lot of questions you will need to complete before being approved. This will help Steam to decide on the audiences that are suitable for your game. It is best to give them as much detail as you can to prevent any hiccups down the line!

    If you're releasing on other platforms, you might want to look up guidelines for what age rating your game should have. Although you won't ever be able to prevent your game being seen or played by people who are below your age rating entirely, you should never encourage underage people to play your game or advertise to underage audiences or actively allow them easy access to your game. 
    
    Being aware of and avoiding underage audiences is especially important for games with NSFW content, which includes horror/violence as well as \"mature\" topics and nudity. So this will need to be thought of when advertising your game, too. Only promote it in areas where underage audiences should not be in the first place.

    If you're ever in doubt about what age band to put your content, lean towards the higher bracket of the options you're considering. It might slightly limit your audience, but it will give you some protection.

    As well as preventing underage people playing inappropriate content, your age rating can also serve a purpose in giving potential players an idea of what to expect and whether they want to play. Not every adult is only looking to play higher age rated games, after all!
    
    For your older audience it may also tell them whether it is safe to play your game in the presence of siblings, children, or other relatives who may not want to view that content. Which moves us on to content warnings! What a neat little transition that was!
