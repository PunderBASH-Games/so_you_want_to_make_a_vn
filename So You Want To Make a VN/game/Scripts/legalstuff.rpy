    pn """
    Preventing Piracy

    - Compiling Builds. When you release your finished game, or even your demo, you will make a \"build\". This will take all of your files and assets to compile it into a single program. That makes it harder for people to take individual pieces like art or music files, and they can't see your source code in the files. When testing, only give people builds of the game rather than sending them all of your uncompiled files and folders.

    - Archiving. People with more knowledge than me can tell you how to further protect the files inside your builds, but do remember that determined people will still have ways past this, it'll just take them longer.

    - Release Platforms. Releasing your demo or game will likely require it to be on a storefront like Steam or itch.io and these will have their own publishing procedures to help protect your game. Always check the agreements, terms, and how trustworthy a site is before uploading your game to it for release, particularly if it isn't a well known and used store front like Itch and Steam.

    - Using Github and Collaborating. If you're working with a team and using file sharing or collaborative tools like Github, keep your repositories private to protect the contents. Only allow people access who actually {i}need{/i} access to the source files in order to fulfil their development role. A public repo can be accessed by the public, so they'll be able to see what's in there and all the change logs as you make them too.

    - Google Drive and Other File Sharing. If you're distributing with tools like Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar, one way to protect those files is to restrict access. Google Drive you can have permission only access, so people will need to be logged in with their email address. This doesn't stop them pirating from there, but it does give you full control over who has access which you can revoke at any time.

    A Brief Guide to Age Ratings
    
    Age ratings will tell your players what age group audience your game is appropriate for. This is very likely to vary with different regions, as different countries have different standards for what is considered age appropriate for different groups.

    Because of the localised differences, you might find your game has a higher rating in some places than others. Generally though unless your VN gets very popular, you won't need to get approval from specific licencing boards.

    Steam already has its own way of determining content and age groups. When you go through the process of publishing your game to Steam, you will find they have a lot of questions you will need to complete before being approved. This will help Steam to decide on the audiences that are suitable for your game. It is best to give them as much detail as you can to prevent any hiccups down the line!

    If you're releasing on other platforms, you might want to look up guidelines for what age rating your game should have. Although you won't ever be able to prevent your game being seen or played by people who are below your age rating entirely, you should never encourage underage people to play your game or advertise to underage audiences or actively allow them easy access to your game. 
    
    Being aware of and avoiding underage audiences is especially important for games with NSFW content, which includes horror/violence as well as \"mature\" topics and nudity. So this will need to be thought of when advertising your game, too. Only promote it in areas where underage audiences should not be in the first place.

    If you're ever in doubt about what age band to put your content, lean towards the higher bracket of the options you're considering. It might slightly limit your audience, but it will give you some protection.

    As well as preventing underage people playing inappropriate content, your age rating can also serve a purpose in giving potential players an idea of what to expect and whether they want to play. Not every adult is only looking to play higher age rated games, after all!
    
    For your older audience it may also tell them whether it is safe to play your game in the presence of siblings, children, or other relatives who may not want to view that content. Which moves us on to content warnings! What a neat little transition that was!

    pn """
    A Brief Guide to Content Warnings

    Aside from age ratings, you may also want to consider content warnings. 
    
    This will allow people to avoid topics that they may find to be disturbing or even harmful to their mental health. It can also apply for things like flashing images or other sounds and images that could trigger episodes of physical health issues such as migraines or epilepsy.
    
    Content warnings are a way of being considerate to your audience. When your game is available to the public, you no longer know everyone who will have access to it or who might play it, or what they may need to avoid in there games.

    Of course, sometimes you might not want to be too specific because a specific content warning might spoil a big plot twist in your game! But this is where you can allow the players the option to view content warnings if they want to or skip them if they don't.

    You can do this by having basic content warnings on your main store page (for example, \"this game contains violence and graphic imagery\"), and then have a link to another page which would show people more detail on the specifics they might encounter if they know there are things they would not want to encounter in a game.

    You can also do this inside your game, by using some nested labels and even warning people that the specifics may spoil some of your surprises. 

    That said, having warnings inside your game is not a substitute for general topic content warnings on your store page. If people find out after they have downloaded your game that it contains unsuitable content, you'll only have an unhappy customer and a refund to deal with.

    Some people might feel that giving content warnings is unreasonable or partonising to your audience, or even reducing your potential audience size.
    
    However what you will more likely find from your players and potential players is that those people who do not need content warnings will ignore them, but those people who {i}do{/i} need them will appreciate them and may even be more willing to try the game because they know what to expect and can prepare accordingly.

    You don't need to warn for every little detail, but there are some broad topics that it is usually good to give warnings about. If you're not sure, see if any of the topics listed on {b}{a=https://www.doesthedogdie.com/}Does The Dog Die{/a}{/b} - this is a website made specifically to help people find and avoid difficult topics in media.

    pn """
    General Legal Concerns - {i}{b}As a disclaimer, none of this is official legal advice. Always check the laws for individual regions where appropriate.{/b}{/i}

    Most of the legal considerations with making Visual Novels comes under 2 categories.

    1. Who owns the content being distributed within the game?

    2. Is it legal to distribute/sell the game in the target countries?

    For the first one, it's all about your assets. Make sure you have ownership, licences, or permission for anything that goes into your game, and credit people where appropriate.

    Anyone who has access to your game files before you build them should be aware of who owns each part of the content, and where they are and are not allowed to share that content.

    Every last asset you use, even down to your fonts for the text, should be checked for permissions and protected in your final build. 
    
    Some assets, like some free to use fonts, might even have rules against having them available in game files outside of a build. So if you have the font inside your files on somewhere like GitHub where other people have access, that might be breaking the licence agreement because that raw file for the font is available for people to download in a usable format. 

    When you build your game, your assets are compiled into a working game program which means people are not able to simply open the folder and access individual assets like the font or images. This means people cannot easily extract the usable font from the game files, giving it protection from being redistributed. 

    If course, piracy is always a possibility, but if you are only distributing your game once it has been compiled and built you are likely doing enough to prevent any accusations of knowingly giving access to assets beyond the agreed usage.

    If you are in any doubt over these topics, it is recommended to seek expert legal advice for your region. I am not a legal expert, and even if I were I would be unlikely to know every relevant law for all the possible regions you may be acting within. It is your responsibility to do your due diligence here, I can only give you some vague pointers.
    
    Regarding the second point, whether it is legal to distribute/sell your game in the target countries, again this will be down to you to check. 
    
    Look at the countries in which your game is available, and also familiarise yourself with the Terms and Conditions of the release platforms (eg, Steam, itch, app stores, etc). 

    Keep your age rating and relevant content warnings clear, concise, and easy to access. Be aware that your age rating might differ across regions or even online release platforms. 

    Again, if you are in any doubt, seek expert legal advice from someone with knowledge and experience of the relevant countries/regions. 

    As a final general note, those of you who are using places like Kickstarter or Patreon to raise funds for your project will need to be careful that your project does not break the terms of service for those sites.
