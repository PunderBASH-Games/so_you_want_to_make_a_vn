        A Brief Guide to Content Warnings
    
        Aside from age ratings, you may also want to consider content warnings. 
        
        This will allow people to avoid topics that they may find to be disturbing or even harmful to their mental health. It can also apply for things like flashing images or other sounds and images that could trigger episodes of physical health issues such as migraines or epilepsy.
        
        Content warnings are a way of being considerate to your audience. When your game is available to the public, you no longer know everyone who will have access to it or who might play it, or what they may need to avoid in there games.
    
        Of course, sometimes you might not want to be too specific because a specific content warning might spoil a big plot twist in your game! But this is where you can allow the players the option to view content warnings if they want to or skip them if they don't.
    
        You can do this by having basic content warnings on your main store page (for example, "this game contains violence and graphic imagery"), and then have a link to another page which would show people more detail on the specifics they might encounter if they know there are things they would not want to encounter in a game.
                                                                                                           ^
    
        You can also do this inside your game, by using some nested labels and even warning people that the specifics may spoil some of your surprises. 
    
        That said, having warnings inside your game is not a substitute for general topic content warnings on your store page. If people find out after they have downloaded your game that it contains unsuitable content, you'll only have an unhappy customer and a refund to deal with.
    
        Some people might feel that giving content warnings is unreasonable or partonising to your audience, or even reducing your potential audience size.
        
        However what you will more likely find from your players and potential players is that those people who do not need content warnings will ignore them, but those people who {i}do{/i} need them will appreciate them and may even be more willing to try the game because they know what to expect and can prepare accordingly.
    
        You don't need to warn for every little detail, but there are some broad topics that it is usually good to give warnings about. If you're not sure, see if any of the topics listed on {b}{a=https://www.doesthedogdie.com/}Does The Dog Die{/a}{/b} - this is a website made specifically to help people find and avoid difficult topics in media.

        Ideas to help you get motivated:
        
        - Listen to music. Headphones can also help to tune out distractions and get you focusing in on the work at hand. Pick some playlists, make some new ones, or just put something on that makes you feel inspired.
    
        - Play some games. No, really! Either replay that VN that inspired you to make your own, or play some new VN games that you haven't played before. The secret part here is you can class it as research by making a few notes on tropes/features that you like/dislike and want to include/avoid in your game!
    
        - Switch tasks. If you're working on more than one part of your game (for example, writing and background art) then if you're hitting a creative wall on one task switch to a different task. Go back to the other one when you feel ready to. Variety can help the work feel fresh and interesting.
    
        - Talk to people. Dev communities, like the Ren'py discord server, can be really good places to find motivation and inspiration. Talk to your team if you have one too, but if you're a solo dev you can really increase your chances of finishing your project by talking to fellow developers about the process.
    
        - Take a break. Walk away, put it down, and do something completely different. Unless you're working on a jam or a tight deadline, taking time off from development is not always a bad idea. Tell yourself you're going back to it later, but for the here and now you're going to have a little holiday. Then when you go back, you'll be more refreshed and ready to go.
    
        - Do something related to development, but not on your project. Keep the creative gears turning on something close to your project but not your actual project. Maybe this is writing a brief few paragraphs of "what if"s scenes for your characters, or maybe it's drawing some fanart for something else you love. Whatever you feel like!
    
        - Go back to the drawing board. This doesn't mean starting again, it just means going back to your planning and looking over things again. See if there's anything you want to change, or just check over the things you've done.
    
        - Play your own game. Hit the launch button and play through what you already have, even if it isn't anywhere near done. Seeing the parts in place and looking at how it is coming together can be great motivation to keep going to make it better, and it's also handy to keep testing for bugs and keep an eye out for errors.

        Ideas to help you get motivated:
        
        - Listen to music. Headphones can also help to tune out distractions and get you focusing in on the work at hand. Pick some playlists, make some new ones, or just put something on that makes you feel inspired.
    
        - Play some games. No, really! Either replay that VN that inspired you to make your own, or play some new VN games that you haven't played before. The secret part here is you can class it as research by making a few notes on tropes/features that you like/dislike and want to include/avoid in your game!
    
        - Switch tasks. If you're working on more than one part of your game (for example, writing and background art) then if you're hitting a creative wall on one task switch to a different task. Go back to the other one when you feel ready to. Variety can help the work feel fresh and interesting.
    
        - Talk to people. Dev communities, like the Ren'py discord server, can be really good places to find motivation and inspiration. Talk to your team if you have one too, but if you're a solo dev you can really increase your chances of finishing your project by talking to fellow developers about the process.
    
        - Take a break. Walk away, put it down, and do something completely different. Unless you're working on a jam or a tight deadline, taking time off from development is not always a bad idea. Tell yourself you're going back to it later, but for the here and now you're going to have a little holiday. Then when you go back, you'll be more refreshed and ready to go.
    
        - Do something related to development, but not on your project. Keep the creative gears turning on something close to your project but not your actual project. Maybe this is writing a brief few paragraphs of "what if"s scenes for your characters, or maybe it's drawing some fanart for something else you love. Whatever you feel like!
    
        - Go back to the drawing board. This doesn't mean starting again, it just means going back to your planning and looking over things again. See if there's anything you want to change, or just check over the things you've done.
    
        - Play your own game. Hit the launch button and play through what you already have, even if it isn't anywhere near done. Seeing the parts in place and looking at how it is coming together can be great motivation to keep going to make it better, and it's also handy to keep testing for bugs and keep an eye out for errors.

        Ideas to help you get motivated.
        
        - Listen to music. Headphones can also help to tune out distractions and get you focusing in on the work at hand. Pick some playlists, make some new ones, or just put something on that makes you feel inspired.
    
        - Play some games. No, really! Either replay that VN that inspired you to make your own, or play some new VN games that you haven't played before. The secret part here is you can class it as research by making a few notes on tropes/features that you like/dislike and want to include/avoid in your game!
    
        - Switch tasks. If you're working on more than one part of your game (for example, writing and background art) then if you're hitting a creative wall on one task switch to a different task. Go back to the other one when you feel ready to. Variety can help the work feel fresh and interesting.
    
        - Talk to people. Dev communities, like the Ren'py discord server, can be really good places to find motivation and inspiration. Talk to your team if you have one too, but if you're a solo dev you can really increase your chances of finishing your project by talking to fellow developers about the process.
    
        - Take a break. Walk away, put it down, and do something completely different. Unless you're working on a jam or a tight deadline, taking time off from development is not always a bad idea. Tell yourself you're going back to it later, but for the here and now you're going to have a little holiday. Then when you go back, you'll be more refreshed and ready to go.
    
        - Do something related to development, but not on your project. Keep the creative gears turning on something close to your project but not your actual project. Maybe this is writing a brief few paragraphs of "what if"s scenes for your characters, or maybe it's drawing some fanart for something else you love. Whatever you feel like!
    
        - Go back to the drawing board. This doesn't mean starting again, it just means going back to your planning and looking over things again. See if there's anything you want to change, or just check over the things you've done.
    
        - Play your own game. Hit the launch button and play through what you already have, even if it isn't anywhere near done. Seeing the parts in place and looking at how it is coming together can be great motivation to keep going to make it better, and it's also handy to keep testing for bugs and keep an eye out for errors.
